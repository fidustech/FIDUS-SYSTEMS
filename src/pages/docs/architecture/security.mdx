## Security Layers

### Client-Side Security
- HTTPS/TLS encryption for all communications
- JWT-based authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure session management

### API Security
- Token-based authentication
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request validation and sanitization
- CORS policy enforcement

### Data Security
- Data encryption at rest
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging
- Regular security audits

## Best Practices

1. **Authentication**
   - Secure password policies
   - Multi-factor authentication support
   - Session management

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control
   - Principle of least privilege
   - Regular access reviews

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption in transit and at rest
   - Secure backup procedures
   - Data retention policies
